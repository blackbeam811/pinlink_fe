          At the heart of PinLinkâ€™s innovation lies our DePIN RWA-Tokenization
          model. The RWA-Tokenized model reduces costs for DePIN service users,
          creates more flexible monetization options for DePIN asset owners, and
          offers opportunities for individuals who do not own DePIN assets to
          earn a passive income stream.

          By selling fractions of their NFTs, DePIN asset owners can unlock the
          capital needed to purchase new assets from which they can generate
          additional rental income, thus creating an asset accumulation
          flywheel.
          <br />
          By purchasing fractions of NFTs, individuals who do not own DePIN
          assets gain access to a share of the revenue from these assets.

          Developers can acquire customized, low-latency, highly reliable,

          cost-efficiently, thanks to PinLink Service User Rebate Model. In this
          Model, NFT sales generate upfront capital payments, which are then
          invested in generative, yield-bearing activities. These activities
          create new revenue sources for PinLink ecosystem and offer rebates to
          end users to lower their cost burden.
